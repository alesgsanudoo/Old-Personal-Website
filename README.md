# My Website (Not finished)
This is my personal portfolio. 
It is a simple page with `HTML, CSS, and Javascript`. I am still learning, so there are things that might not make sense. 
- I will try to improve it in summer as I am planning to practice **react**. 
 
It is not finished since I plan to make it on react :)

**Thanks!!!** Love Alex â™¥
